# KM-plots
 
This project is about misinterpretation of Kaplan-Meier curves when tables below the curve do not show the complete data of the study.
In this project we show that the table below the curve needs to contain the cummulative events, cummulative  
censored and cummulative at risk patients to get a complete picture of the data.
